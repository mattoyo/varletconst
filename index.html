Const = 3.14

Var is function scope whereas let is block scope. Addtionally var can be redeclared and reassigned whereas let can only be reassigned.

Const is block scope compared to var. Also Const cannot be redclared or reassigned unlike var which can do both.

const can not be redclared or reassigned. However, while let cannot be redclared it can be reassigned.

Hoistng is the idea that a variable can be used before it is declared such as when using var (conceptually as if the variables are placed at the top of the page when loaded)
